                                    <p>Health risk refers to the potential for adverse health outcomes and financial
                                        burdens due to illness or injury. Health financing is essential for achieving
                                        universal health coverage, involving revenue raising, pooling funds, and
                                        purchasing services. Risk financing focuses on how health entities manage and
                                        pay for these risks effectively, utilizing methods like insurance and
                                        risk-sharing. Ultimately, financial risk protection ensures individuals can
                                        access necessary health services without facing catastrophic costs.</p>

                                    <p>Occupational health is crucial for ensuring worker well-being, productivity, and
                                        economic sustainability. The economic burden of occupational diseases and
                                        injuries poses significant challenges, affecting both workers and industries.
                                        Effective policy analysis can drive interventions that enhance workplace safety,
                                        especially in the informal sector and among vulnerable groups. Strengthening
                                        occupational health frameworks contributes to sustainable development, mental
                                        well-being, and resilience in times of crisis.</p>

                                    <p>Climate change and environmental degradation pose significant health risks,
                                        affecting vulnerable populations disproportionately. Rising temperatures,
                                        extreme weather events, and pollution contribute to the spread of infectious
                                        diseases, respiratory issues, and mental health concerns. Environmental
                                        governance frameworks, such as DeGrowth, LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment), Green
                                        Transition, and Green Recovery, aim to mitigate these impacts by promoting
                                        sustainable policies and responsible resource use. Addressing these challenges
                                        requires a multidimensional approach that integrates climate resilience,
                                        gender-sensitive health policies, and international collaboration to ensure
                                        equitable health outcomes.</p>

                                    <p>This call for papers seeks contributions examining the critical dimensions of
                                        health system governance, policy, and institutional frameworks, emphasizing
                                        their role in shaping health policy and service delivery. We invite analyses of
                                        national and sub-national governance models, policy implementation challenges,
                                        and innovative strategies for strengthening health systems. A key focus is
                                        health system responsiveness, which ensures that healthcare services meet
                                        individuals' needs efficiently and equitably. Papers exploring patient-centered
                                        care, community engagement, and accountability mechanisms, along with studies on
                                        disparities in responsiveness and policy interventions for improvement, are
                                        particularly welcome. Another essential aspect is health literacy at both
                                        individual and organizational levels, which significantly influences health
                                        outcomes. Contributions may examine how individuals access health information,
                                        navigate healthcare systems, and make informed health decisions, as well as how
                                        organizations can promote health literacy through digital health tools,
                                        communication strategies, and policy interventions.</p>

                                    <p>Gender inequality in health and development remains a significant barrier to
                                        achieving equitable well-being worldwide. Women often face disparities in access
                                        to healthcare, nutrition, and economic opportunities, leading to poorer health
                                        outcomes. Structural factors such as discriminatory social norms, unequal
                                        resource distribution, and limited decision-making power exacerbate these
                                        challenges. Addressing gender-based inequities requires targeted policies,
                                        inclusive healthcare systems, and empowerment initiatives that ensure equal
                                        opportunities for all, ultimately fostering sustainable development and improved
                                        public health.</p>
