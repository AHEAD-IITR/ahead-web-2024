                                    <p>Amid global disruptions in healthcare and development, managing health and
                                        financial risks is more urgent than ever. Over 930 million people worldwide
                                        spend more than 10% of their income on healthcare, pushing many into poverty.
                                        Strengthening health financing through risk pooling, insurance, and strategic
                                        purchasing, is essential to achieving universal health coverage. Effective risk
                                        financing enables systems to absorb shocks, while financial protection ensures
                                        access to care without catastrophic costs.</p>

                                <div class="track-content">
                                    <p>Occupational health is crucial for ensuring worker well-being, productivity, and
                                        economic sustainability. The economic burden of occupational diseases and
                                        injuries poses significant challenges, affecting both workers and industries.
                                        Effective policy analysis can drive interventions that enhance workplace safety,
                                        especially in the informal sector and among vulnerable groups. Strengthening
                                        occupational health frameworks contributes to sustainable development, mental
                                        well-being, and resilience in times of crisis.</p>

                                </h3>

                                    <p>Climate change and environmental degradation pose significant health risks,
                                        affecting vulnerable populations disproportionately. Rising temperatures,
                                        extreme weather events, and pollution contribute to the spread of infectious
                                        diseases, respiratory issues, and mental health concerns. Environmental
                                        governance frameworks, such as DeGrowth, LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment), Green
                                        Transition, and Green Recovery, aim to mitigate these impacts by promoting
                                        sustainable policies and responsible resource use. Addressing these challenges
                                        requires a multidimensional approach that integrates climate resilience,
                                        gender-sensitive health policies, and international collaboration to ensure
                                        equitable health outcomes.</p>

                                    <p>This track explores the persistent gender inequalities in health and development,
                                        which hinder equitable well-being worldwide. Women and girls continue to face
                                        disparities in healthcare access, nutrition, reproductive rights, and economic
                                        opportunity, often resulting in poorer health outcomes. These are shaped by
                                        discriminatory social norms, unequal resource distribution, limited
                                        decision-making power, and gaps in financial protection, etc. The track also
                                        emphasizes the critical role of institutions in shaping reproductive health and
                                        child well-being, focusing on how socio-economic, cultural, and environmental

                                        examine structural determinants, propose gender-sensitive policy reforms, and
                                        highlight innovative strategies for improving healthcare access, quality with a

                                    <p>Aging is a global challenge and increasingly shaped by worldwide disruptions like
                                        pandemics, climate change, and geopolitical instability with significant
                                        economic, social, and policy implications, requiring societies to reassess
                                        healthcare, legal rights, housing, and social services while promoting society's
                                        engagement and inclusivity. Medical advancements continue to redefine aging
                                        management, while social and cultural perspectives shape family roles, community
                                        support, and end-of-life care. On a personal level, aging brings shifts in
                                        relationships, independence, and living arrangements, necessitating adaptation
                                        and comprehensive support systems.</p>
